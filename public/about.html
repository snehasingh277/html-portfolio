<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Sneha Singh and i am 18 year old. I am from Kanpur , Uttar Pradesh and i have done my schooling
  from Mother Teresa Mission Higher Secondary School in Kanpur itself. I belong to a non medical 
  background and have a keen interest in tech as well. I have scored 96% in my 10th boards and 92% in my
  12th boards.</p>
  <p>I have been coding since my school days as it was a part of my school curriculam
  but so far due to my fervent interest in programming i have learnt various other concepts 
  in the field of computer science. I am knowledgeable in programming language java
  and i am nowadays learning full stack development as well which includes the concept of html ,css and javascript.</p>
  <p>Apart from being an academic validated kid, I was particularly interested in organising annual events and 
  hosting school functions.
   I am also an avid reader and enjoy non-fiction and business books. I also love music but my music taste fluctuates 
   too often as like being a programmer we switch from one programming language to another oftenly haha.</p>
   <p>So yes that was all about me and for the future i am looking forward to extend this list 
    of learning new things in upcoming years and would to love connect with the most creative minds and work together 
    to build something . Thankyou so much! </p>
